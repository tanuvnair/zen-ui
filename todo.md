# todo.md

Tracking work that's deliberately deferred for after the shadcn / Radix
component migration is complete. Each item should be promoted to its own
issue / PR when its turn comes.

---

## Housekeeping / release readiness

The migration on `ui-refactor` is feature-complete but hasn't been
prepped for release. Decide each of these before any merge / publish.

- [ ] **Branch strategy** — `master` is still at the initial commit.
      Open a PR for `ui-refactor` → `master`, or keep as a long-lived
      branch?
- [ ] **CHANGELOG.md + version bump** — this is a breaking change set
      (new exports, legacy types renamed `Legacy*`, primary export
      shapes changed). Recommend v3.0.0 with a written migration
      guide alongside.
- [ ] **README update** — current README / DEV_GUIDE.md /
      library_usage.md still describe the legacy API.
- [ ] **Remote push** — branch only lives locally; `git remote add` +
      `git push -u` when ready for collaborators.
- [ ] **Unit + interaction tests** — none exist on the new components.
      Cover at minimum: keyboard nav on DropdownMenu / Select,
      indeterminate Checkbox, Switch + RadioGroup form submission
      round-trips, asChild composition through Button's Slottable.
- [ ] **`Math.random()` → `React.useId()` audit** — flagged in
      docs/rp-review-1.md (P1-4). Migration mostly replaced these
      organically (Radix primitives use useId internally), but a final
      grep should confirm zero remaining call sites in the new code.
- [ ] **Final tick-through of [docs/rp-review-1.md](docs/rp-review-1.md)
      P0/P1 items** — most are resolved by the migration; confirm and
      mark closed.
- [ ] **Bundle size** — current Vite build emits a ~1.96 MB JS chunk.
      Code-split the library entry; split per-component imports.
- [ ] **Drop heavy deps from `dependencies`** — `onnxruntime-web`
      (~10 MB), `raygun4js`, `regenerator-runtime`, `react-flags-select`
      should move to `peerDependencies` / `optionalDependencies` or be
      removed.

## Phase 2 — Component behaviours (after all components are migrated)

Once the migration is complete, the library needs to add capabilities
that are common to data-heavy UIs but are not part of the headless
primitives themselves. Treat these as **per-component opt-ins**, not as
a global concern.

### Up next — in this order

1. [x] **`<DataTable>`** built on `@tanstack/react-table` +
       `@tanstack/react-virtual`. Single primitive with toggleable
       capabilities so callers compose what they need:
       - [x] `enableVirtualization` (off by default; flip on for ≥ 200 rows)
       - [x] `enablePagination` (client-side; with page-size selector)
       - [x] `manualPagination` (server-driven cursors)
       - [x] `enableSorting` (per-column toggle)
       - [x] `enableColumnFilters` (global filter)
       - [x] `enableRowSelection` (Checkbox in a select column)
       - [x] `enableColumnVisibility` (DropdownMenu of columns)
       - [x] empty state, loading state, error state

   **Follow-ups (all opt-in, separate commits):**
   - [x] `enableColumnOrdering` — drag column headers to reorder
         (@dnd-kit horizontalListSortingStrategy). `onColumnOrderChange`
         callback lets the caller persist the order (e.g. localStorage).
   - [x] `enableColumnResizing` — drag the right edge of any header.
         `columnResizeMode: "onChange"` so the body updates live.
   - [x] `enableColumnPinning` — pin columns to the left/right edge.
         `initialColumnPinning={{ left, right }}` for the common static case;
         `columnPinning` + `onColumnPinningChange` for controlled. Pinned cells
         get sticky offsets + a soft inner-edge shadow. Combines with
         `stickyHeader` for a 2-D freeze. Works in virtualized mode too
         when pinned columns have explicit `size` on the column def.
   - [x] `stickyHeader` — pin the `<thead>` to the top of the scroll viewport
         in non-virtualized mode. Body wraps in a `maxBodyHeight` container so
         sticky has a real scroll context. Virtualized mode already does this.
   - [x] `enableGrouping` — group by one or more columns with built-in
         sum/mean/count aggregations via `aggregationFn` +
         `aggregatedCell`. Toolbar `Group by` menu lists every
         groupable column. Hard-gated against `enableVirtualization`
         (would mis-display aggregates as scalars) — emits a dev-mode
         `console.error` when both are configured.
   - [x] `renderSubRow` — caller-rendered detail panel beneath each
         expanded row with a chevron toggle column. Hard-gated against
         `enableVirtualization` (variable sub-row height).
   - [x] **Per-column filters** — `enablePerColumnFilters` renders an
         Input row under each filterable header; composes with the
         global filter. Now wired in virtualized mode too.
   - [x] **Per-column filter operators** — `meta.filterVariant` picks
         text / number / numberRange / select / boolean inputs and
         auto-attaches the matching `filterFn`. Text/number variants
         expose contains/equals/starts/ends + ≥/≤/etc. operator menus.
   - [x] **Active filter chips + clear-all** — auto-shown above the
         table when any filter is set; one chip per active filter with
         ✕, plus a Clear-all button.
   - [x] **Multi-sort** — `enableMultiSort` prop; Shift-click adds a
         secondary sort. Header shows a small priority badge.
   - [x] **CSV / JSON export** — `enableExport` adds a toolbar menu;
         exports the filtered set (or `exportOnlySelected` for the
         checked rows). Utility columns (`__select`, `__drag`) excluded.
   - [x] **Inline cell editing** — `meta.editable` on a column +
         `onCellEdit` on the table. Double-click (or Enter when focused)
         swaps the cell for the matching input (text / number / select).
         Enter + blur commit, Esc cancels.
   - [x] **Bulk-action bar** — `renderBulkActions` shows a contextual
         toolbar when ≥ 1 row is selected, with built-in selected count,
         dismiss ✕, and a "Select all N matching" affordance when the
         filter has more matches than the current page.
   - [x] **rowClassName hook** — per-row styling callback merged after
         hover / selected classes. Status-based row tinting.
   - [x] **getRowId** — exposed for stable row identity across re-renders
         (row selection / reorder / inline edit all key by row.id).
   - [x] **manualSorting / manualFiltering** — server-driven escape
         hatches matching the existing `manualPagination`. All three
         compose for a fully server-driven table.
   - [x] **persistKey** — localStorage snapshot of column order /
         sizing / visibility / pinning, versioned for shape-change
         safety.
   - [x] **a11y polish** — aria-sort on headers, aria-colcount on virt,
         aria-busy on body during loading, aria-labelledby for "Rows
         per page", aria-live count in the bulk-action bar.
   - [ ] **Excel / PDF export** — would pull in `xlsx` / `jspdf` deps;
         CSV + JSON cover most needs today.
   - [ ] **Tests** — none of the DataTable behaviors are unit-covered.

2. [x] **Lazy-loaded options for Select + DropdownMenu** —
       `<VirtualizedItems>` helper shipped under
       `src/components/listbox/`. Used by `DataTable` virtualization,
       `Lazy options` demo, and a Combobox-with-VirtualizedItems pattern.
       - Gotcha documented: Radix `<SelectValue>` reads its label from
         the mounted `<SelectItem>`. With a virtualized list the selected
         row may be unmounted, so the demo renders the label manually
         via a value→label `Map`. Consider providing a helper
         `<VirtualizedSelectValue>` that closes over the same map.
3. [x] **`<Combobox>` primitive** — cmdk-backed, single component with
       both sync (`options`) and async (`onSearch`) modes. Debounce
       (configurable), AbortController + monotonic-seq to cancel stale
       requests, loading / empty states baked in. The async mode
       supersedes the previously-planned `<AsyncSelect>` — same API.
4. [x] **`<AsyncSelect>`** — merged into Combobox's async mode
       (`onSearch` prop). No separate component needed.

### Performance — other

- [ ] **Avatar** lazy `<img>` decoding via `loading="lazy"` (Safari
      already supports this; just add the attr).
- [ ] **Skeleton** suspense-aware variant that auto-hides when its
      boundary settles.

### Async / data integration

- [ ] **Suspense / loading boundaries** at each async component. Avoid
      ad-hoc spinners; use `<Skeleton>` consistently.

### Forms

- [x] **Form primitives** — Form, FormField, FormItem, FormLabel,
      FormControl, FormDescription, FormMessage with the shadcn
      pattern on react-hook-form. Resolver-agnostic; Zod wired into
      the demo at /form-new.
- [ ] **Async / server-validated fields** — submit-handler integration
      for slow remote validations (debounced + cancelable; useTransition).

### A11y polish

- [ ] **`prefers-reduced-motion`** — gate all CSS animations behind
      `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)`.
- [ ] **RTL audit** — verify Radix's logical-property defaults render
      correctly in `dir="rtl"`.
- [ ] **High-contrast / forced-colors** — make sure focus rings and
      borders remain visible under Windows High Contrast and macOS
      Increase Contrast.

### Tooling

- [ ] **Storybook (or Ladle)** alongside the demo app so each component
      has individual stories, controls, and a11y panel.
- [ ] **Visual regression** via Chromatic / Playwright snapshots,
      gated on PR.
- [ ] **Unit / interaction tests** with `vitest` +
      `@testing-library/react`. Cover keyboard nav and form submission
      paths.

### Theming

- [x] **Theme switcher dropdown** in the demo shell (header).
- [x] **Default theme** (current `--zen-*` palette / Algorisys brand).
- [x] **Zen theme** — full official color spec applied (Primary,
      Neutral, Success, Info, Warning, Destructive — 10-step shade
      scales each).
- [x] **Zen theme — remaining artifacts applied** (refinement pass):
      - shadows-blur → `--zen-shadow-xs/sm/md/lg/xl/2xl`
        tokens shipped in `tokens.css` per spec (Neutral/500 base colour
        + conventional alpha; xxlarge is pure black per spec). UnoCSS
        utilities `shadow-zen-*` exposed in `uno.config.ts`. `App.css`
        sticky-header shadow adopts `--zen-shadow-xs`.
      - spacing → `--zen-space-0…16` scale in `tokens.css`
        (4-px grid; derived from layout-grid + table + alert spec
        values).
      - table → `data-table/table.tsx` matches spec:
        header is XSmall Medium + Neutral/200; cell padding 12 / 8;
        row borders Neutral/50; selected-row gets primary-tinted drop
        shadow (`0 4px 12px var(--zen-color-primary-soft)`).
      - alert → `<Alert>` primitive shipped under
        `src/components/alert/alert.tsx` — compound API (Alert / Icon /
        Content / Title / Description / Actions / Close), `color`
        (neutral / primary / info / success / warning / destructive)
        × `variant` (soft / outline). Demo at `/alert`.
- [x] **Dark theme** — shipped for free since it falls out of the same
      `data-theme` mechanism.
- [x] **Demo chrome dark-mode contrast pass** — every hardcoded hex in
      `demo-helpers.css`, `Welcome.tsx`, and the `NewXxxDemo.tsx` files
      swept to `var(--zen-color-*)` references so cards / heads /
      previews re-tint in the dark theme.
- [ ] **High-contrast theme** for forced-colors environments.
- [ ] **Token sync with the rest of Algorisys products** — consider exposing
      the palette as a small JSON / TS file consumable by other apps.

### Distribution

- [ ] **shadcn-CLI compatibility** — publish a `components.json` and
      rename the design tokens to shadcn defaults
      (`--primary`, `--background`, `--ring`, …) so consumers can
      `npx shadcn add card` and have it slot in.
- [ ] **Code-split the bundle** — current Vite build emits a ~1.7 MB
      JS chunk. Tree-shake `svg_components.tsx` (42 KB of icons) and
      split per-component entries.
- [ ] **Drop `onnxruntime-web`, `raygun4js`, `regenerator-runtime`** from
      `dependencies` (or move to `peerDependencies`); they don't belong
      in a UI library.

## Roadmap — onboarding + data-collection journey apps

Components to add to make this library a strong primary toolkit for
customer onboarding flows, KYC journeys, surveys, and form-heavy
application apps. Prioritized by ROI based on modern form / onboarding
UX research (Baymard, Stripe Elements, NNG, *Form Design Patterns*).

### Tier 1 — high-impact essentials (build first)

- [x] **Stepper / Wizard** — compound API: `Stepper` / `StepperList` /
      `StepperPanel` / `StepperNavigation` + `useStepper()` hook.
      Horizontal + vertical orientation, linear (default) +
      non-linear modes, per-step status override (`pending` /
      `current` / `completed` / `error`), `onBeforeNext` gate so
      `form.trigger()` blocks forward navigation on validation
      failure. Demo at `/stepper` wires a 4-step onboarding with
      RHF + Zod.
- [x] **Tabs** — Radix-backed compound (Tabs / TabsList / TabsTrigger /
      TabsContent). `underline` (default) + `pills` variants, both
      with horizontal + vertical orientation. Disabled triggers,
      controlled + uncontrolled. Demo at `/tabs`.
- [x] **Accordion / Collapsible** — Radix-backed (Accordion /
      AccordionItem / AccordionTrigger / AccordionContent). `single`
      + `multiple` expand modes; `single collapsible` for closeable
      one-at-a-time. Animated height transition via Radix's
      `--radix-accordion-content-height` + keyframes in tokens.css.
      Demo at `/accordion`.
- [x] **Card** — generic surface (Card / CardHeader / CardTitle /
      CardDescription / CardContent / CardFooter) with `elevated` /
      `outlined` (default) / `ghost` variants. Plus **SelectableCard**
      + **SelectableCardGroup** on top of Radix RadioGroup for the
      onboarding "pick one" pattern (goal picker, plan picker) with
      icon / title / description / badge slots and a check indicator
      when selected. Demo at `/card`.
- [x] **Drawer / Sheet** — Radix Dialog with slide-from-edge animation.
      `side` prop: right (default) / left / top / bottom. Compound API
      (Sheet / SheetTrigger / SheetContent / SheetHeader / SheetTitle
      / SheetDescription / SheetFooter / SheetClose). Built-in ✕
      (toggleable via `showCloseButton={false}`). Demo at `/sheet`.
- [x] **Empty State** — compound API (Icon / Title / Description /
      Actions). `size` sm/md/lg, optional `bordered` dashed-frame for
      drop-zones / placeholder regions. Demo at `/empty-state`.
- [x] **Banner** — compound API mirroring Alert (Icon / Content / Title
      / Description / Actions / Close); spans container width, optional
      `sticky` pin to viewport top. 6 color tokens. Demo at `/banner`.
- [ ] **Stepper-progress visualization** — numbered-dot horizontal bar
      separate from the wizard itself + "Step 2 of 5" label. Distinct
      from `<Progress>` which is a `<progress>`-style bar.

### Tier 2 — journey-specific (KYC, surveys, signups)

- [ ] **Signature pad** — canvas-based drawing → SVG / data URL. Loan
      disclosure, T&Cs, healthcare consent.
- [ ] **Camera capture / Selfie** — `getUserMedia` wrapper with
      front/rear toggle, capture, retake. KYC liveness + profile photo.
- [ ] **ID document upload** — specialized FileUpload variant with
      front + back slots, edge detection / glare warnings, crop,
      file-type lock.
- [ ] **Image cropper** — after upload or capture. Circle / rect modes,
      zoom, rotate. Pairs with Camera capture + Avatar uploader.
- [ ] **Address autocomplete** — Combobox + provider adapter
      (Google Places / Mapbox / OS). Single biggest checkout-time
      reducer (~30 % per Baymard).
- [x] **Rating** (5-star) — `<Rating>` with hover preview, arrow-key
      nav (radiogroup semantics), 3 sizes, customizable `max`,
      `allowClear` toggle on the active star, read-only display mode,
      optional hidden input for native form submission. Demo at
      `/rating`.
- [x] **NPS** — `<NPS>` 0–10 strip with standard detractor (0–6) /
      passive (7–8) / promoter (9–10) buckets color-coded via existing
      error/warning/success tokens. Selected score gets the saturated
      bucket fill. Anchor labels customizable, optional bucket caption
      below ("8 · Promoter"). Demo at `/nps`.
- [x] **Likert scale** — `<Likert>` n-point attitudinal scale.
      Default 5-point Strongly disagree → Strongly agree; pass
      `options` for any attitudinal scale (agreement / frequency /
      importance / ease / satisfaction). Two layouts: `segmented`
      (default — compact pill strip) and `stacked` (vertical radio
      list, more readable). Demo at `/likert`.
- [x] **Range slider** (two-handle) — already shipped. The existing
      `<Slider>` auto-renders one Radix Thumb per value in the array
      (`defaultValue={[20, 80]}`), so range is just an array-shaped
      value. Demo at `/slider-new` section 3.
- [x] **Date-range picker** — `<DateRangePicker>` built on
      react-day-picker's `mode="range"` inside a Popover. Returns the
      DateRange shape `{from?, to?}`. Default `numberOfMonths={2}` for
      the Airbnb / Booking side-by-side layout; drop to 1 for narrow
      popovers. Re-uses the existing Calendar component. Demo at
      `/date-range-picker`.
- [x] **Tag / chip input** — `<TagInput>` with type+Enter commit,
      Backspace-on-empty remove, paste-splits-on-delimiters, optional
      per-tag `validate`, `max` cap, `unique` dedupe. Chips render as
      removable pills (or via a `renderTag` override). Demo at
      `/tag-input`.
- [x] **Multi-select Combobox** — `<MultiCombobox>` sibling of
      Combobox with `value: string[]` semantics. Selected items render
      as removable chips inside the trigger with `maxDisplayed`
      collapse into "+N more". Same sync / async option-loading story
      as Combobox (debounce + AbortController + monotonic seq). Label
      cache keeps chip labels human even when the async result page
      rotates. Built-in Clear-all footer affordance. Demo at
      `/multi-combobox`.

### Tier 3 — friction reducers (move the needle on completion)

- [ ] **Inline help / hint icon** — small `?` next to a field label;
      tooltip on hover, popover on tap. Reduces support tickets.
- [ ] **AutoSaveIndicator** — "Saved 2 s ago" / "Saving…" badge.
      Auto-save is table-stakes for any form ≥ 2 minutes long.
- [ ] **RestoreDraftPrompt** — "We found unsaved work from yesterday.
      Restore?". Pairs with `useAutoSave` hook below.
- [ ] **Onboarding tour / coachmarks** — spotlight + tooltip sequence
      (Shepherd / Driver.js patterns) for post-signup product tours.
- [ ] **Confirmation-with-typing AlertDialog** — "Type DELETE to
      confirm". Variant of existing AlertDialog.
- [ ] **Field error / success border state** — auto red/green ring
      after blur tied to RHF state. Visual sibling of FormMessage.

### Tier 4 — specialized but high-leverage in the right vertical

- [ ] **Currency input** — NumberField + locale-aware formatting +
      symbol prefix + thousand separators (₹1,00,000 vs $100,000).
- [x] **Time picker** + **DateTime picker** — scheduling /
      appointments. _Shipped: segmented HH:MM(:SS) input, 12h / 24h,
      AM/PM, auto-advance + arrow stepping; DateTimePicker composes
      Calendar + TimePicker in one Popover._
- [ ] **Country picker** — specialized Combobox with flag + ISO + dial
      code. Often paired with PhoneInput.
- [x] **QR scanner** — `getUserMedia` + jsQR. Payments, doc handoff,
      device pairing. _Shipped: native `BarcodeDetector` (Chromium /
      Safari 17+) with `decode` escape hatch for browsers without it
      so the library doesn't bundle a heavy polyfill._
- [ ] **Command palette** — `cmdk` already a dep via Combobox; surface
      as `<CommandPalette open shortcut="cmd+k">` for power-user apps.
- [ ] **Map / geolocation picker** — pluggable Leaflet / Mapbox;
      pick-a-pin or "near me" for service apps.

### Cross-cutting (patterns / hooks, not components)

- [ ] **Conditional fields** as a Form-builder pattern
      (`<BoundField visibleWhen={…}>`). Critical in journey apps where
      Q3 only appears if Q2 = X.
- [ ] **`useAutoSave(form, fn)`** — debounced save with a small state
      machine (idle / saving / saved / error). Powers
      AutoSaveIndicator + RestoreDraftPrompt.
- [ ] **`useFormFlow` / step-graph** — non-linear stepper navigation
      where the next step depends on previous answers.
- [ ] **RTL + locale audit** — token system already covers the visual
      half; verify `dir="rtl"` works through every primitive (Radix
      handles most, but DataTable / DropdownMenu position calcs may
      need a pass).

### Recommended initial cut

If we're optimizing for "we can build a real onboarding flow tomorrow",
the smallest shipable set is:

1. Stepper / Wizard
2. Card (selection variant)
3. Drawer / Sheet
4. Address autocomplete (with a swappable provider adapter)
5. Signature pad

## Roadmap — CRM & ERP-class applications

The onboarding roadmap above optimises for forms-heavy linear journeys.
Building **CRM (with kanban)** and **ERP (with master + transaction
nested forms)** apps surfaces a new class of needs: long-lived record
views, drag-and-drop pipelines, line-item grids, hierarchy navigation,
and dense desktop layouts. This section captures the gap; group by
component class (primitive / compound / layout / hook) so authors can
slot work into the right tier of the library.

### Layout primitives (cross-cutting; both CRM and ERP need them)

- [ ] **ResizablePanes / Splitter** — horizontal + vertical split with a
      draggable gutter; persists ratio in localStorage. Master-detail
      and side-by-side panels rely on this.
- [ ] **MasterDetailLayout** — opinionated two-pane wrapper on top of
      ResizablePanes (list left, detail right, mobile = stacked).
- [ ] **PageHeader** — title + subtitle + breadcrumb + actions slot.
      Every CRUD page rolls its own today; standardise.
- [ ] **Toolbar** — action-bar primitive with overflow `…` menu when
      space is tight. Useful in card-detail, line-item rows, kanban
      column headers.

### Display compound components

- [ ] **KanbanBoard** — multi-column draggable cards (@dnd-kit, already
      a dep). Drag between columns, optional WIP limits, swim lanes,
      virtualised column body for long lists. CRM-anchor component.
- [ ] **Timeline / ActivityFeed** — chronological list of events with
      icon prefix + day-grouping + "load more". Deal history, customer
      interactions, audit log.
- [ ] **TreeView** — hierarchical list with expand/collapse, drag-to-
      reparent, lazy-load children. Chart of accounts, BOM, org tree,
      folder structures.
- [ ] **PipelineStages** — read-only horizontal stage indicator (Lead
      → Qualified → Proposal → Won). Cousin of Stepper but for display
      rather than navigation.
- [ ] **ApprovalChain** — multi-stage approval indicator with avatars +
      status per stage. ERP / workflow staple.
- [ ] **AuditTrail** — who-changed-what diff list. Shaped like Timeline
      but rows are `{ field, oldValue, newValue, by, at }`.
- [x] **NotificationsInbox** — bell + dropdown panel with read/unread,
      grouping by day, action buttons inline. _Shipped: Popover-backed
      panel, auto unread-count badge with `99+` cap and override,
      day-grouped sections (Today / Yesterday / weekday / date),
      per-row actions slot, controlled open, `onItemSelect` +
      `onMarkAllRead` + optional `onViewAll` footer link._
- [ ] **UserMenu / WorkspaceSwitcher** — top-right account chip + org
      switcher. Universal across CRM/ERP/SaaS.

### Form / input primitives (record-detail editors)

- [ ] **InlineEdit** — standalone click-to-edit text/select/date field
      for record-detail pages. DataTable already has cell-level edit;
      this is the surface for single-record screens.
- [ ] **LookupField** — code+description autocomplete with "create
      new on the fly" (vendor / customer / item picker). Scan-by-code
      semantics are different from MultiCombobox's filter-by-substring.
- [ ] **AddressBlock** — composite (line1 / line2 / city / state / zip
      / country) with country-aware label swaps + per-country
      validation hooks. Pairs with the Tier-4 address autocomplete.
- [ ] **TagPicker** — multi-tag with creatable + per-tag color
      management. TagInput is the input layer; this adds the color
      registry.
- [ ] **MentionsInput** — `@username` autocomplete on a Textarea.
      Cmdk-powered, similar in shape to MultiCombobox.
- [ ] **ContextMenu** — right-click menu. Radix `ContextMenu` exists
      and is unwrapped; ~30-min wrap to land it.

### Form composition compounds (ERP master + transaction shape)

- [ ] **LineItems / RepeatingFields** — header + row pattern (invoice
      header + N line items) with add / duplicate / delete / reorder,
      RHF `useFieldArray` integration. Drives ~80 % of ERP UIs.
- [ ] **EditableGrid** — spreadsheet-feel data entry: Tab moves
      cell→cell, paste-from-Excel, copy-down (Ctrl+D), formula cells.
      Distinct from DataTable's one-cell inline edit; this is the
      data-entry version. ERP-anchor component.
- [ ] **FormSection** — Accordion-shaped but form-aware: validates
      collapsed sections, shows an error-count badge on the section
      header, scrolls into view on first invalid submit.
- [ ] **CommentThread** — threaded comments with author + timestamp +
      reply layout + edit / delete + soft-deleted markers. Anchor for
      collaboration features.

### Hooks / patterns (no JSX surface)

- [ ] **useCalculatedField** — derived RHF field that recomputes from
      sibling values (line total, GST, grand total). Thin RHF helper.
- [ ] **useConditionalField** — show / hide / require based on another
      field's value. Pairs with the onboarding-roadmap entry but
      formalises it as a hook with a TypeScript-friendly predicate.

### Anchor components — build these first

Just like Stepper + Sheet anchored the onboarding tier, two components
unlock the bulk of CRM/ERP use cases:

1. **KanbanBoard** — unlocks CRM-class apps.
2. **LineItems + EditableGrid** (paired) — unlocks ERP-class apps.

The rest in this section is half-day or less per item; these two are
the 1–2-day builds where the depth investment shows up.

## Fiori work — queued (2026-07-15)

Tracked against `docs/fiori-gap-analysis.md`. Tier numbering is that doc's.

**Done, both bindings**: icon set (48), Object atoms, Button family, Tree,
Toolbar (overflow), Page, Bar.

- [ ] **Global search across the demo** (requested) — a Cmd/Ctrl-K command
      palette over every route. Natural fit: `Command` now exists in both
      bindings, and `src/nav.ts` is already the single source of truth for the
      sidebar AND the landing catalogue, so the palette can render from it with
      no third list to drift. Must land in React AND Solid per the parity rule.
- [ ] **Tier 1 — app frame** (in progress): ShellBar, FlexibleColumnLayout,
      DynamicPage (snapping header), ObjectPageLayout (scroll-spy anchors).
      This is what actually makes an app read as Fiori.
- [ ] **Tier 3 — table ecosystem**: FilterBar, VariantManagement, p13n dialog,
      ValueHelp, SelectDialog, ViewSettingsDialog, AnalyticalTable, TreeTable,
      spreadsheet export. DataTable has the mechanics; these are the surrounding
      dialogs, and most only make sense with a persistence story behind them —
      decide that first.
- [ ] **Tier 4 — NOT RECOMMENDED**: Smart controls, micro charts, launchpad
      tiles, planning calendars, floorplans. The gap analysis recommends against
      building these: they encode SAP's backend, OData annotations and
      Launchpad, not a design language. Revisit only if targeting real SAP
      integration.

### Known-latent, found while porting

- [ ] Checkbox, RadioGroupItem and Select land a caller's `id` on the wrapper
      rather than the native control, so `<label for>` will not associate —
      Kobalte derives sub-part ids from the root. Same class as the Switch bug
      already fixed.
- [ ] Solid lint: 57 findings on its first-ever run (33 `solid/reactivity`,
      4 `solid/no-destructure` in data-table). These silently break reactivity
      and are invisible to tsc and the build. Fixing them changes runtime
      behaviour, so it deserves its own commit.
- [ ] Demo section-count gap: React has ~305 code examples to Solid's 158,
      because Solid's demos have genuinely fewer SECTIONS. Closing it means
      adding sections, not snippets.
- [ ] `Toast` is the last export gap: React wraps Radix Toast primitives, Solid
      uses solid-toast. A real API divergence — converge or accept it.
