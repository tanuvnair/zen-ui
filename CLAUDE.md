# zen-ui

Bun workspace. A shadcn/Radix-style component library published as two framework
bindings that share one design core.

| Package | What it is |
|---|---|
| `packages/core` — `@algorisys/zen-ui-core` | Framework-agnostic: design tokens, UnoCSS theme + prefix, `cn()`, theme primitives. Private, consumed via workspace link. |
| `packages/react` — `@algorisys/zen-ui-react` | React binding (Radix-backed) **+ the demo app** in the same `src/`. |
| `packages/solid` — `@algorisys/zen-ui-solid` | Solid binding (Kobalte-backed) + its demo. Mirrors the React API. |
| `apps/landing` | Marketing page. Ships CSS to nobody; depends on `core` only. |

## Development guidelines

**Read [LOOPS.md](LOOPS.md) before doing substantial work in this repo.** It is
the engineering contract: 40 rules across 7 tiers covering read-before-write,
scope lock, verification, TDD, deviation rules, comment style, and safety.

**It is also the reference for autonomous development over long periods** —
Tier 6 (Agent Loops, rules XXVII–XXXV) covers writing the loop rather than the
prompt, separating roles, negotiating the contract first, writing state to disk
instead of context, letting the loop restart, scoring subjective work, reading
traces, and deleting the harness. Tier 5 (XXIII–XXVI) covers the traceability
that makes a long unattended run recoverable: changelog, `IMPLEMENT.md`
tracking, and keeping state resumable.

## Commands

Run from the repo root (Bun workspaces; Node 22.12.0 via `.nvmrc`):

```bash
bun install

bun run dev:all          # every demo behind one URL -> localhost:5170

bun run dev              # React demo   (base /builder)
bun run dev:solid        # Solid demo   (base /builder-solid)
bun run dev:landing

bun run build:lib        # publishable React lib -> packages/react/dist
bun run build:lib:solid
bun run lint             # lint:solid for the Solid binding
```

`dev:all` is the one to reach for when comparing the bindings: React and Solid
cannot share a vite server (the two JSX transforms fight over the same files),
so it runs one child server per binding on an OS-assigned free port and proxies
each binding's base path to its child. You open one port; the split stays an
implementation detail. Adding a framework is one entry in
[scripts/demos.mjs](scripts/demos.mjs) — the hub page, the proxy table and the
spawned servers all derive from it.

The landing app is the exception: its base is `/`, the same path the hub
occupies, so it is linked on its own port rather than proxied. Re-basing it
under `/landing` would break every absolute asset URL it serves.

Three things that bit while building it, and will bite the next edit:

- **A base that is a prefix of another base silently mis-routes.** `/builder` is
  a prefix of `/builder-solid`, so a plain string proxy key sent every Solid URL
  to the React server, which answered with its own 404 — while the hub started
  perfectly and the page looked right. The keys are anchored regexes
  (`^/builder(/|$)`) for that reason — do not "simplify" them back.
- **Killing a detached child right after spawning it races setsid().**
  `detached: true` means the child calls `setsid()` *after* the fork, so
  `process.kill(-pid)` fired milliseconds later throws `ESRCH`, the signal
  reaches nobody, and the child survives as an orphan holding its port — where
  it answers the next run's health check. The hub failing on a taken port does
  exactly this, and stranded four vite servers. `killGroup()` retries through
  `ESRCH` for that reason.
- **Child ports are deliberately not pinned.** Vite's default 5173 is probably
  already taken by your own `bun run dev`, and nobody types the child ports
  anyway.

Note `build` (demo) and `build:lib` (library) both write to `packages/*/dist`
and clobber each other — rebuild the lib before inspecting `dist/style.css`.

### Verification traps — all three have produced false passes here

- **`tsconfig.lib.json` cannot see demos.** It excludes `src/**/*Demo.tsx`, so
  `tsc --project tsconfig.lib.json --noEmit` reports clean on a demo containing a
  hard type error. For demo files use `--project tsconfig.app.json`, which `npm
  run build` (`tsc -b`) also covers.
- **A syntax error in ONE file silently disables type-checking for the whole
  project** — tsc bails before the semantic pass, so every other file reports
  clean. If a run looks suspiciously green, check for parse errors first.
- **Lint baselines**: Solid 8 errors / 47 warnings; React 29 problems. Measure
  before you claim a delta — a stated baseline that is off by one turns "adds
  nothing" into "adds one".
- **A CSS import that resolves to nothing still builds green.** A dependency's
  `exports` map can block a subpath (`ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`) and Vite
  drops the import silently rather than erroring — the build passes and the
  component renders unstyled. RichText shipped exactly this: jodit's toolbar
  icons have no width attribute, so with no stylesheet they expanded to a 930px
  chevron. If you import a dep's CSS, assert it reached the bundle
  (`grep <a-known-class> dist/assets/*.css`), not merely that the build passed.
- **A failed command looks identical to a clean one** when you grep its output
  for error lines. `lint:solid` returned "0 issues" for a long time purely
  because ESLint aborted on a missing config. Assert the tool actually ran.

Green output is not evidence. Prefer running the thing: `node
scripts/visual-check.mjs <react|solid> [routes…]` boots the demo's preview
server, screenshots each route from `nav.ts`, and reports per-route console and
page errors. A build says nothing about whether a panel is clipped, a switch
landed on the wrong side, or a class silently generated no CSS — all three have
shipped here.

## CSS conventions — read before touching a component

The full rationale is in [docs/css-interop.md](docs/css-interop.md). The rules
that bite:

- **Utilities are prefixed `zen-`.** Variants sit *outside* the prefix:
  `hover:zen-bg-zen-primary`, `-zen-mt-2`, `!zen-p-4`, `data-[state=open]:zen-p-4`.
  Anchors are prefixed too (`zen-group`, `zen-peer`).
- **`ZEN_PREFIX`** in `packages/core/src/uno-preset.ts` is shared by every
  binding's `uno.config.ts` *and* by `cn()`. They must not drift apart.
- **Never ship page-level or element-level CSS from a library entry.** The
  published stylesheet may only touch elements zen-ui renders and `--zen-*`
  custom properties. `index.css` belongs to the demo (`main.tsx`), not to
  `index.ts`. The element reset is opt-in via the `/preflight` export.
- **No raw `rem` literals in component source.** Use utilities or `--zen-*`
  tokens. The repo used to assume `html { font-size: 62.5% }` (1rem = 10px);
  that rule is gone, so any bare `1.4rem` is a magic number that no longer means
  what it says.
- **Hand-written animation classes are `zen-anim-*`, not `zen-animate-*`** —
  under the prefix, `zen-animate-fade-in` parses as `animate-fade-in`, a real
  UnoCSS built-in, and Uno emits a competing rule. (`zen-animate-spin` /
  `zen-animate-pulse` *are* genuine Uno utilities.)
- `apps/landing` is deliberately unprefixed — it has nothing to collide with.

## Binding parity — React and Solid must stay in sync

**A component added to one binding must be added to the other.** The two are one
design system with two renderers; a component that exists only in React is a
bug, not a roadmap item. The same applies to props, variants and behaviour: if
you change a component's API in one binding, change it in the other in the same
change.

The demos must match too — same routes, same sections, same code examples.

Current state (was: 10 families missing from Solid, and code examples in 1/48 of
its demos):

- **Exports**: React 219, Solid 204. The only gap is the **Toast** family, and
  that one is a real API divergence rather than a missing port — React wraps
  Radix Toast primitives, Solid uses solid-toast. Decide whether to converge the
  API before "porting" it.
- **Code examples**: React 54/54 demos (~305 examples), Solid 55/57 (158). The
  two demos without have no `DemoSection` to attach one to. The remaining gap is
  section COUNT, not snippets — Solid's demos genuinely have fewer sections.
- **Known latent, same class as the fixed ones**: Checkbox, RadioGroupItem and
  Select still land a caller's `id` on the wrapper rather than the native
  control, so `<label for>` will not associate. Kobalte derives sub-part ids from
  the root.

Before adding anything new, check the delta:

```bash
# component exports present in one binding but not the other
diff <(grep -oE 'export \{ [A-Z][A-Za-z]+' packages/react/src/index.ts | sort -u) \
     <(grep -oE 'export \{ [A-Z][A-Za-z]+' packages/solid/src/index.ts | sort -u)
```

When porting, port behaviour rather than syntax, and mirror the React API —
see LOOPS.md rule XXXVI. Solid's `PopoverContent` once accepted only
`class`/`children` while React's forwarded everything, which silently dropped
`style` and clipped the NotificationsInbox panel. That class of bug is what
parity prevents.

## Demo conventions

Each binding has one `src/nav.ts` — the single source of truth for **both** the
sidebar and the landing-page catalogue. Adding a component means: add it to
`nav.ts`, add its `<Route>`. Nothing else. (They were previously two hand-kept
lists and drifted 16 entries apart.)

## Theming

Override `--zen-*` custom properties; that is the whole public theming surface.
Three built-in themes via `data-theme`: `default`, `zen-theme`, `dark`. Token
reference is in the [README](README.md#token-reference).
