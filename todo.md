# todo.md

Tracking work that's deliberately deferred for after the shadcn / Radix
component migration is complete. Each item should be promoted to its own
issue / PR when its turn comes.

---

## Housekeeping / release readiness

The migration on `ui-refactor` is feature-complete but hasn't been
prepped for release. Decide each of these before any merge / publish.

- [ ] **Branch strategy** — `master` is still at the initial commit.
      Open a PR for `ui-refactor` → `master`, or keep as a long-lived
      branch?
- [ ] **CHANGELOG.md + version bump** — this is a breaking change set
      (new exports, legacy types renamed `Legacy*`, primary export
      shapes changed). Recommend v3.0.0 with a written migration
      guide alongside.
- [ ] **README update** — current README / DEV_GUIDE.md /
      library_usage.md still describe the legacy API.
- [ ] **Remote push** — branch only lives locally; `git remote add` +
      `git push -u` when ready for collaborators.
- [ ] **Unit + interaction tests** — none exist on the new components.
      Cover at minimum: keyboard nav on DropdownMenu / Select,
      indeterminate Checkbox, Switch + RadioGroup form submission
      round-trips, asChild composition through Button's Slottable.
- [ ] **`Math.random()` → `React.useId()` audit** — flagged in
      docs/rp-review-1.md (P1-4). Migration mostly replaced these
      organically (Radix primitives use useId internally), but a final
      grep should confirm zero remaining call sites in the new code.
- [ ] **Final tick-through of [docs/rp-review-1.md](docs/rp-review-1.md)
      P0/P1 items** — most are resolved by the migration; confirm and
      mark closed.
- [ ] **Bundle size** — current Vite build emits a ~1.96 MB JS chunk.
      Code-split the library entry; split per-component imports.
- [ ] **Drop heavy deps from `dependencies`** — `onnxruntime-web`
      (~10 MB), `raygun4js`, `regenerator-runtime`, `react-flags-select`
      should move to `peerDependencies` / `optionalDependencies` or be
      removed.

## Phase 2 — Component behaviours (after all components are migrated)

Once the migration is complete, the library needs to add capabilities
that are common to data-heavy UIs but are not part of the headless
primitives themselves. Treat these as **per-component opt-ins**, not as
a global concern.

### Up next — in this order

1. [x] **`<DataTable>`** built on `@tanstack/react-table` +
       `@tanstack/react-virtual`. Single primitive with toggleable
       capabilities so callers compose what they need:
       - [x] `enableVirtualization` (off by default; flip on for ≥ 200 rows)
       - [x] `enablePagination` (client-side; with page-size selector)
       - [x] `manualPagination` (server-driven cursors)
       - [x] `enableSorting` (per-column toggle)
       - [x] `enableColumnFilters` (global filter)
       - [x] `enableRowSelection` (Checkbox in a select column)
       - [x] `enableColumnVisibility` (DropdownMenu of columns)
       - [x] empty state, loading state, error state

   **Follow-ups (all opt-in, separate commits):**
   - [x] `enableColumnOrdering` — drag column headers to reorder
         (@dnd-kit horizontalListSortingStrategy). `onColumnOrderChange`
         callback lets the caller persist the order (e.g. localStorage).
   - [x] `enableColumnResizing` — drag the right edge of any header.
         `columnResizeMode: "onChange"` so the body updates live.
   - [x] `enableColumnPinning` — pin columns to the left/right edge.
         `initialColumnPinning={{ left, right }}` for the common static case;
         `columnPinning` + `onColumnPinningChange` for controlled. Pinned cells
         get sticky offsets + a soft inner-edge shadow. Combines with
         `stickyHeader` for a 2-D freeze. Works in virtualized mode too
         when pinned columns have explicit `size` on the column def.
   - [x] `stickyHeader` — pin the `<thead>` to the top of the scroll viewport
         in non-virtualized mode. Body wraps in a `maxBodyHeight` container so
         sticky has a real scroll context. Virtualized mode already does this.
   - [x] `enableGrouping` — group by one or more columns with built-in
         sum/mean/count aggregations via `aggregationFn` +
         `aggregatedCell`. Toolbar `Group by` menu lists every
         groupable column. Hard-gated against `enableVirtualization`
         (would mis-display aggregates as scalars) — emits a dev-mode
         `console.error` when both are configured.
   - [x] `renderSubRow` — caller-rendered detail panel beneath each
         expanded row with a chevron toggle column. Hard-gated against
         `enableVirtualization` (variable sub-row height).
   - [x] **Per-column filters** — `enablePerColumnFilters` renders an
         Input row under each filterable header; composes with the
         global filter. Now wired in virtualized mode too.
   - [x] **Per-column filter operators** — `meta.filterVariant` picks
         text / number / numberRange / select / boolean inputs and
         auto-attaches the matching `filterFn`. Text/number variants
         expose contains/equals/starts/ends + ≥/≤/etc. operator menus.
   - [x] **Active filter chips + clear-all** — auto-shown above the
         table when any filter is set; one chip per active filter with
         ✕, plus a Clear-all button.
   - [x] **Multi-sort** — `enableMultiSort` prop; Shift-click adds a
         secondary sort. Header shows a small priority badge.
   - [x] **CSV / JSON export** — `enableExport` adds a toolbar menu;
         exports the filtered set (or `exportOnlySelected` for the
         checked rows). Utility columns (`__select`, `__drag`) excluded.
   - [x] **Inline cell editing** — `meta.editable` on a column +
         `onCellEdit` on the table. Double-click (or Enter when focused)
         swaps the cell for the matching input (text / number / select).
         Enter + blur commit, Esc cancels.
   - [x] **Bulk-action bar** — `renderBulkActions` shows a contextual
         toolbar when ≥ 1 row is selected, with built-in selected count,
         dismiss ✕, and a "Select all N matching" affordance when the
         filter has more matches than the current page.
   - [x] **rowClassName hook** — per-row styling callback merged after
         hover / selected classes. Status-based row tinting.
   - [x] **getRowId** — exposed for stable row identity across re-renders
         (row selection / reorder / inline edit all key by row.id).
   - [x] **manualSorting / manualFiltering** — server-driven escape
         hatches matching the existing `manualPagination`. All three
         compose for a fully server-driven table.
   - [x] **persistKey** — localStorage snapshot of column order /
         sizing / visibility / pinning, versioned for shape-change
         safety.
   - [x] **a11y polish** — aria-sort on headers, aria-colcount on virt,
         aria-busy on body during loading, aria-labelledby for "Rows
         per page", aria-live count in the bulk-action bar.
   - [ ] **Excel / PDF export** — would pull in `xlsx` / `jspdf` deps;
         CSV + JSON cover most needs today.
   - [ ] **Tests** — none of the DataTable behaviors are unit-covered.

2. [x] **Lazy-loaded options for Select + DropdownMenu** —
       `<VirtualizedItems>` helper shipped under
       `src/components/listbox/`. Used by `DataTable` virtualization,
       `Lazy options` demo, and a Combobox-with-VirtualizedItems pattern.
       - Gotcha documented: Radix `<SelectValue>` reads its label from
         the mounted `<SelectItem>`. With a virtualized list the selected
         row may be unmounted, so the demo renders the label manually
         via a value→label `Map`. Consider providing a helper
         `<VirtualizedSelectValue>` that closes over the same map.
3. [x] **`<Combobox>` primitive** — cmdk-backed, single component with
       both sync (`options`) and async (`onSearch`) modes. Debounce
       (configurable), AbortController + monotonic-seq to cancel stale
       requests, loading / empty states baked in. The async mode
       supersedes the previously-planned `<AsyncSelect>` — same API.
4. [x] **`<AsyncSelect>`** — merged into Combobox's async mode
       (`onSearch` prop). No separate component needed.

### Performance — other

- [ ] **Avatar** lazy `<img>` decoding via `loading="lazy"` (Safari
      already supports this; just add the attr).
- [ ] **Skeleton** suspense-aware variant that auto-hides when its
      boundary settles.

### Async / data integration

- [ ] **Suspense / loading boundaries** at each async component. Avoid
      ad-hoc spinners; use `<Skeleton>` consistently.

### Forms

- [x] **Form primitives** — Form, FormField, FormItem, FormLabel,
      FormControl, FormDescription, FormMessage with the shadcn
      pattern on react-hook-form. Resolver-agnostic; Zod wired into
      the demo at /form-new.
- [ ] **Async / server-validated fields** — submit-handler integration
      for slow remote validations (debounced + cancelable; useTransition).

### A11y polish

- [ ] **`prefers-reduced-motion`** — gate all CSS animations behind
      `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)`.
- [ ] **RTL audit** — verify Radix's logical-property defaults render
      correctly in `dir="rtl"`.
- [ ] **High-contrast / forced-colors** — make sure focus rings and
      borders remain visible under Windows High Contrast and macOS
      Increase Contrast.

### Tooling

- [ ] **Storybook (or Ladle)** alongside the demo app so each component
      has individual stories, controls, and a11y panel.
- [ ] **Visual regression** via Chromatic / Playwright snapshots,
      gated on PR.
- [ ] **Unit / interaction tests** with `vitest` +
      `@testing-library/react`. Cover keyboard nav and form submission
      paths.

### Theming

- [x] **Theme switcher dropdown** in the demo shell (header).
- [x] **Default theme** (current `--zen-*` palette / Algorisys brand).
- [x] **Zen theme** — full official color spec applied (Primary,
      Neutral, Success, Info, Warning, Destructive — 10-step shade
      scales each).
- [x] **Zen theme — remaining artifacts applied** (refinement pass):
      - shadows-blur → `--zen-shadow-xs/sm/md/lg/xl/2xl`
        tokens shipped in `tokens.css` per spec (Neutral/500 base colour
        + conventional alpha; xxlarge is pure black per spec). UnoCSS
        utilities `shadow-zen-*` exposed in `uno.config.ts`. `App.css`
        sticky-header shadow adopts `--zen-shadow-xs`.
      - spacing → `--zen-space-0…16` scale in `tokens.css`
        (4-px grid; derived from layout-grid + table + alert spec
        values).
      - table → `data-table/table.tsx` matches spec:
        header is XSmall Medium + Neutral/200; cell padding 12 / 8;
        row borders Neutral/50; selected-row gets primary-tinted drop
        shadow (`0 4px 12px var(--zen-color-primary-soft)`).
      - alert → `<Alert>` primitive shipped under
        `src/components/alert/alert.tsx` — compound API (Alert / Icon /
        Content / Title / Description / Actions / Close), `color`
        (neutral / primary / info / success / warning / destructive)
        × `variant` (soft / outline). Demo at `/alert`.
- [x] **Dark theme** — shipped for free since it falls out of the same
      `data-theme` mechanism.
- [x] **Demo chrome dark-mode contrast pass** — every hardcoded hex in
      `demo-helpers.css`, `Welcome.tsx`, and the `NewXxxDemo.tsx` files
      swept to `var(--zen-color-*)` references so cards / heads /
      previews re-tint in the dark theme.
- [ ] **High-contrast theme** for forced-colors environments.
- [ ] **Token sync with the rest of Algorisys products** — consider exposing
      the palette as a small JSON / TS file consumable by other apps.

### Distribution

- [ ] **shadcn-CLI compatibility** — publish a `components.json` and
      rename the design tokens to shadcn defaults
      (`--primary`, `--background`, `--ring`, …) so consumers can
      `npx shadcn add card` and have it slot in.
- [ ] **Code-split the bundle** — current Vite build emits a ~1.7 MB
      JS chunk. Tree-shake `svg_components.tsx` (42 KB of icons) and
      split per-component entries.
- [ ] **Drop `onnxruntime-web`, `raygun4js`, `regenerator-runtime`** from
      `dependencies` (or move to `peerDependencies`); they don't belong
      in a UI library.

- [x] Foundation (cn, tokens, preflight, CVA, Slot, UnoCSS rem postprocess)
- [x] Button
- [x] Tooltip
- [x] DropdownMenu
- [x] Separator
- [x] Switch
- [x] Checkbox
- [x] RadioGroup
- [x] Progress
- [x] Avatar
- [x] Badge
- [x] Skeleton
- [x] Loading
- [x] Select
- [x] Slider

## Roadmap — onboarding + data-collection journey apps

Components to add to make this library a strong primary toolkit for
customer onboarding flows, KYC journeys, surveys, and form-heavy
application apps. Prioritized by ROI based on modern form / onboarding
UX research (Baymard, Stripe Elements, NNG, *Form Design Patterns*).

### Tier 1 — high-impact essentials (build first)

- [x] **Stepper / Wizard** — compound API: `Stepper` / `StepperList` /
      `StepperPanel` / `StepperNavigation` + `useStepper()` hook.
      Horizontal + vertical orientation, linear (default) +
      non-linear modes, per-step status override (`pending` /
      `current` / `completed` / `error`), `onBeforeNext` gate so
      `form.trigger()` blocks forward navigation on validation
      failure. Demo at `/stepper` wires a 4-step onboarding with
      RHF + Zod.
- [x] **Tabs** — Radix-backed compound (Tabs / TabsList / TabsTrigger /
      TabsContent). `underline` (default) + `pills` variants, both
      with horizontal + vertical orientation. Disabled triggers,
      controlled + uncontrolled. Demo at `/tabs`.
- [x] **Accordion / Collapsible** — Radix-backed (Accordion /
      AccordionItem / AccordionTrigger / AccordionContent). `single`
      + `multiple` expand modes; `single collapsible` for closeable
      one-at-a-time. Animated height transition via Radix's
      `--radix-accordion-content-height` + keyframes in tokens.css.
      Demo at `/accordion`.
- [x] **Card** — generic surface (Card / CardHeader / CardTitle /
      CardDescription / CardContent / CardFooter) with `elevated` /
      `outlined` (default) / `ghost` variants. Plus **SelectableCard**
      + **SelectableCardGroup** on top of Radix RadioGroup for the
      onboarding "pick one" pattern (goal picker, plan picker) with
      icon / title / description / badge slots and a check indicator
      when selected. Demo at `/card`.
- [x] **Drawer / Sheet** — Radix Dialog with slide-from-edge animation.
      `side` prop: right (default) / left / top / bottom. Compound API
      (Sheet / SheetTrigger / SheetContent / SheetHeader / SheetTitle
      / SheetDescription / SheetFooter / SheetClose). Built-in ✕
      (toggleable via `showCloseButton={false}`). Demo at `/sheet`.
- [x] **Empty State** — compound API (Icon / Title / Description /
      Actions). `size` sm/md/lg, optional `bordered` dashed-frame for
      drop-zones / placeholder regions. Demo at `/empty-state`.
- [x] **Banner** — compound API mirroring Alert (Icon / Content / Title
      / Description / Actions / Close); spans container width, optional
      `sticky` pin to viewport top. 6 color tokens. Demo at `/banner`.
- [ ] **Stepper-progress visualization** — numbered-dot horizontal bar
      separate from the wizard itself + "Step 2 of 5" label. Distinct
      from `<Progress>` which is a `<progress>`-style bar.

### Tier 2 — journey-specific (KYC, surveys, signups)

- [ ] **Signature pad** — canvas-based drawing → SVG / data URL. Loan
      disclosure, T&Cs, healthcare consent.
- [ ] **Camera capture / Selfie** — `getUserMedia` wrapper with
      front/rear toggle, capture, retake. KYC liveness + profile photo.
- [ ] **ID document upload** — specialized FileUpload variant with
      front + back slots, edge detection / glare warnings, crop,
      file-type lock.
- [ ] **Image cropper** — after upload or capture. Circle / rect modes,
      zoom, rotate. Pairs with Camera capture + Avatar uploader.
- [ ] **Address autocomplete** — Combobox + provider adapter
      (Google Places / Mapbox / OS). Single biggest checkout-time
      reducer (~30 % per Baymard).
- [ ] **Rating** (5-star) — feedback collection.
- [ ] **NPS** (0-10 strip with promoter / detractor labels) — survey
      primitive distinct from rating.
- [ ] **Likert scale** (5-point agree/disagree) — also distinct from
      rating; semantically a single-choice question with fixed labels.
- [x] **Range slider** (two-handle) — already shipped. The existing
      `<Slider>` auto-renders one Radix Thumb per value in the array
      (`defaultValue={[20, 80]}`), so range is just an array-shaped
      value. Demo at `/slider-new` section 3.
- [x] **Date-range picker** — `<DateRangePicker>` built on
      react-day-picker's `mode="range"` inside a Popover. Returns the
      DateRange shape `{from?, to?}`. Default `numberOfMonths={2}` for
      the Airbnb / Booking side-by-side layout; drop to 1 for narrow
      popovers. Re-uses the existing Calendar component. Demo at
      `/date-range-picker`.
- [x] **Tag / chip input** — `<TagInput>` with type+Enter commit,
      Backspace-on-empty remove, paste-splits-on-delimiters, optional
      per-tag `validate`, `max` cap, `unique` dedupe. Chips render as
      removable pills (or via a `renderTag` override). Demo at
      `/tag-input`.
- [ ] **Multi-select Combobox** — today's Combobox is single-select.
      Multi with a selected-chip row above the list.

### Tier 3 — friction reducers (move the needle on completion)

- [ ] **Inline help / hint icon** — small `?` next to a field label;
      tooltip on hover, popover on tap. Reduces support tickets.
- [ ] **AutoSaveIndicator** — "Saved 2 s ago" / "Saving…" badge.
      Auto-save is table-stakes for any form ≥ 2 minutes long.
- [ ] **RestoreDraftPrompt** — "We found unsaved work from yesterday.
      Restore?". Pairs with `useAutoSave` hook below.
- [ ] **Onboarding tour / coachmarks** — spotlight + tooltip sequence
      (Shepherd / Driver.js patterns) for post-signup product tours.
- [ ] **Confirmation-with-typing AlertDialog** — "Type DELETE to
      confirm". Variant of existing AlertDialog.
- [ ] **Field error / success border state** — auto red/green ring
      after blur tied to RHF state. Visual sibling of FormMessage.

### Tier 4 — specialized but high-leverage in the right vertical

- [ ] **Currency input** — NumberField + locale-aware formatting +
      symbol prefix + thousand separators (₹1,00,000 vs $100,000).
- [ ] **Time picker** + **DateTime picker** — scheduling /
      appointments.
- [ ] **Country picker** — specialized Combobox with flag + ISO + dial
      code. Often paired with PhoneInput.
- [ ] **QR scanner** — `getUserMedia` + jsQR. Payments, doc handoff,
      device pairing.
- [ ] **Command palette** — `cmdk` already a dep via Combobox; surface
      as `<CommandPalette open shortcut="cmd+k">` for power-user apps.
- [ ] **Map / geolocation picker** — pluggable Leaflet / Mapbox;
      pick-a-pin or "near me" for service apps.

### Cross-cutting (patterns / hooks, not components)

- [ ] **Conditional fields** as a Form-builder pattern
      (`<BoundField visibleWhen={…}>`). Critical in journey apps where
      Q3 only appears if Q2 = X.
- [ ] **`useAutoSave(form, fn)`** — debounced save with a small state
      machine (idle / saving / saved / error). Powers
      AutoSaveIndicator + RestoreDraftPrompt.
- [ ] **`useFormFlow` / step-graph** — non-linear stepper navigation
      where the next step depends on previous answers.
- [ ] **RTL + locale audit** — token system already covers the visual
      half; verify `dir="rtl"` works through every primitive (Radix
      handles most, but DataTable / DropdownMenu position calcs may
      need a pass).

### Recommended initial cut

If we're optimizing for "we can build a real onboarding flow tomorrow",
the smallest shipable set is:

1. Stepper / Wizard
2. Card (selection variant)
3. Drawer / Sheet
4. Address autocomplete (with a swappable provider adapter)
5. Signature pad

That covers ~70 % of a typical fintech / KYC onboarding without
dropping into custom code.
